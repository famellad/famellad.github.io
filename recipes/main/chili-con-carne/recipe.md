## Ingredients

- 1 Medium Tomato, diced
- 50g Carrot, shredded
- 500g Ground Beef<sup>1</sup>

- 100g Red Wine
- 400g Tomato Sauce
- 1 tbsp Sugar

## Preparation
In a medium cooking pot, on high heat, sautée the onion, bell pepper, carrot and garlic, with salt and pepper until it starts getting rather brown. Add the ground beef with salt and pepper<sup>3</sup>, and season with cumin to taste<sup>4</sup>. Once the beef is cooked and the rest of the ingredients start looking rather burnt, add the stock and the sugar, scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon if there's anything stuck to it.

Once the water evaporates you can try the meat, it should be a bit salty for your taste at this stage, if it’s not, add salt until it is.

Pour the wine and give it a good stir, wait until the alcohol evaporates.

Throw in the tomato and stir until they are very soft.

Add the tomato sauce and stir thoroughly, let it simmer on medium heat for 15 minutes. Finally add the beans without draining, let it cook for 5 more minutes.

## Serving
Serve on a bowl with rice, garnish with cilantro leaves.

## Vegetarian Options
Replace ground meat for soy protein, already soaked and flavored with vegetable stock and a bit of soy sauce.

## Final Notes
1. Ground pork and ground turkey work great as well!
2. Pork stock works great, but beef and vegetable stock are fine as well.
3. Pepper is what gives this dish it’s spice, add a lot of it for a spicy meal.
4. Cumin is one of the main ingredients in terms of flavor profile, add to taste, but it should have a healthy amount of it.
